Tiny Travel Tracker could be described as a GPS journal.

Tiny Travel Tracker It's different from other GPS trackers because:

* It can be safely left on all the time. It keeps track of it's own battery usage to prevent excessive battery drain.
* It can handle hundreds of thousands of points-- years with of data, all at once. No need to worry about trying to categorize and save it yourself. It's all there and always available.
* The data is encrypted using 256 AES keys and can be password protected. (It is as secure as communicating with your banking website.) No other malicious apps can make use of the GPS data, and it is completely private. Your data is not uploaded to any website but remains on your phone at all times, and is easily wiped away by uninstalling the app.

It's meant for both traveling to far off places and reviewing your day to day activities.

It can find the answer to questions such as:

* Where did I really go when I got lost on top of that mountain?
* How many times have I been to the gym in the last month?
* Where are some different routes to work that I haven't tried yet, and how long to the routes I choose actually take?
* How many hours have I actually spent in that pool hall?
* What did I do all day on October 27th, 2010?
* Where was that little shop I visited when I was wandering around Tokyo?

It also is useful in situations where you don't have internet access. All map tiles previously viewed are cached on the phone, so even without internet, you can use the map as long as you've looked at previously viewed area. In addition, since the GPS points are stored on the phone, they are always present, regardless of internet availability.

Changelog: (you can monitor the latest build here: https://f-droid.org/wiki/index.php?title=com.rareventure.gps2/lastbuild&redirect=no)

V 1.1.48 (build 91) - 2019 Sep 10

Attempt to fix #83, where Oreo and later Android versions kill the gps recording service.
Now schedules a job which will run every 10 min or so to try and restart the service if stopped.

V 1.1.46 (build 89) - 2019 July 13

Fix so that the gps doesn't turn on and off constantly when at 100%. Thanks Kright!

V 1.1.45 (build 88) - 2019 June 22

Small tweak to hopefully prevent TTT service from being randomly shutdown by the OS in Oreo.

V 1.1.44 (build 87) - 2019 May 6

Added map style with large fonts.

V 1.1.43 (build 86) - 2019 May 2

Found nextzen.org which has the original mapzen maps. This allows me to retire my poorly custom made map that ran against tilehosting.

Added the ability to choose from some different map styles.

Upgraded to Tangram 10.1 which fixes some chinese fonts not showing up.

Integrated igor-cali's italian language translation.

V 1.1.38

Now compatible with Android Oreo.
Fixed problem in error reporting, so I should receive user error messages again.

V 1.1.37

Now compatible with Android M (Marshmallow, Android 6) or above, by fixing
the permissions system.

V 1.1.36 

Attempted fix of issue 76 which causes some ROMS to crash

V 1.1.35 

Small tweak to make drawing faster

V 1.1.34 

Now uses openmaptiles because mapzen.com shut down Feb 1st.

V 1.1.30

Reverted back to V 1.1.28. Mapzen's LOST is too inaccurate even when specifying "high precision"

V 1.1.29

Now uses mapzen's LOST (https://mapzen.com/blog/lets-get-lost/) library to help with gps tracking.

V 1.1.28

Fixed problem in release binary stripped out too many classes and caused immediate crash on open.

V 1.1.27

Tangram updated their map server to be no longer compatible with the version I was using, so I updated it. However, there was a lot of changes on tangram's side and a few bugs are still present. Better than not having maps though.

Specifically:

* blinking dots whenever moving around map. (I may not be able to fix this completely but I will see)
* tiles in offline mode are slow to load. 

I'll try to fix this soonish.

V 1.1.22

* Found and fixed another old bug releated to #50. The amount of time to be allocated to the gps wasn't being
calculated properly. This would manifest itself under the following conditions:

  TTT has been running for a long time uninterrupted
  A GPS signal was not able to be found, or only sporadically.

V 1.1.21

* Hopefully fixed issue #50, cpu was never allowed to sleep. Added option to log to a separate file
  when cpu is kept on under settings.

V 1.1.20

* Reverted code from 1.1.17, which was failing to store points and corrupting the cache 
  in some cases. Added new code which will mark the cache corrupt if an error occurs that 
  indicates this might be the case, so that the next time the application starts it will
  automatically regenerate it.

V 1.1.17

* Now stores accuracy information and prints this out to GPX files as "hdop" (Issue #25)

V 1.1.13

* Fixed problem where selecting a item from the selected area set panel (used to view time periods of
selected points) was not updating screen properly.

V 1.1.11

* Selecting points and long pressing to select point areas works again (it was broken when moving to Mapzen)

V 1.1.9

* Now uses an opengl vector map implementation by Mapzen

V 1.06

* Smooth zooming
* Pinch to zoom works much better
* Double tap to zoom
* Font size of map can be adjusted in settings

V 1.05

* Now uses less battery
